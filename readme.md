# Breast Cancer Detection using Vision Transformer

This project implements a deep learning model for breast cancer detection in mammogram images using a Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture with explainable AI capabilities.

## Overview

The system uses a pre-trained ViT model fine-tuned on mammogram images to classify them as either cancerous or non-cancerous. It includes explainable AI techniques to visualize and interpret the model's decisions.
